A school Management Project

In this project just I started building a Student App.

To run this project create a virtual environment, install django, start a project, and a student_app.
Please follow the following commands for windows using VS Code.

python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

pip install django
django-admin startproject school_management_project
python manage.py runserver
python manage.py startapp student_app
